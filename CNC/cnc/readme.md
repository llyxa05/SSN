# How To Setup SSN CNC

SSN CNC uses a MySQL database so you need to setup a database.

*   Upload the "CNC" folder that you received in the "SSNCNC.zip" onto your server.

1. `sudo apt-get update -y && sudo apt-get upgrade -y`
2. `sudo apt-get install screen phpmyadmin mysql-server mysql-client -y`
	* On the first screen, click the enter key with the first option selected "apache2"
	* On the second screen, click the enter key with the first option selected "<Yes>"
	* On the third screen, input a 32 character varchar password ending in "!?" such as	"4guWEDLGS67PJhXm2sD7xQks7PF8PzuQ!"
3. `sudo mysql`

*   When setting up the database replace the variables. 

	Example variables:

	{DB_TABLE} -> SSNCNC
	{DB_USERNAME} -> cooluserlol
	{DB_PASSWORD} -> 32 character varchar password ending in "!?" such as "BcfNUYVgThVtwHVgVk96wPaYP6efQ9K8!?"

	Note: For "{DB_FILEPATH}", enter the path to where your "database.sql" is located.

	{DB_FILEPATH} -> /root/CNC/assets/database.sql
	
		CREATE DATABASE {DB_TABLE};
		CREATE USER '{DB_USERNAME}'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '{DB_PASSWORD}';
		GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON * . * TO '{DB_USERNAME}'@'localhost';
		FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
		use {DB_TABLE};
		source {DB_FILEPATH}; 
		exit

		Filled Example:

			CREATE DATABASE datatable;
			CREATE USER 'niceusername'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 	'4guWBDLGS67PJhXm2sD7xQks7PF8PzuQ!?';
			GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON * . * TO 'niceusername'@'localhost';
			FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
